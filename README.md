# data-structures
A project that implements data structures and algorithms for vehicle and track management.

## Data Structures

- Linked List: Used to store vehicles and tracks in a queue-like structure.
- Linked Queue: Used to store vehicles in the order in which they will move through the tracks.
- Semaphore Algorithm: Used to regulate the flow of vehicles and ensure safe movement.
- Track Queue Algorithm: Used to manage the flow of vehicles through the tracks.
